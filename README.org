#+Title: Gotil: Some utilities extracted from combosaurus

* Overview

This repo just extends the life of some utilities written for the Go services in Combosaurus, written in 2012.

* hash.go

Implements a standard power of 2 hashtable with quadratic probing. This performed incredibly well in my benchmarking
compared to the maps in Go as of 1.0.

The hash table supports a constant time Clear operation that doesn't reallocate any memory.

* pool.go

Generic resource pool which was utilized to reduce memory allocations of fairly large objects, including the
above hash table.
